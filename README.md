# Gravitational Wave Signal Classification Using Projected Quantum Kernels

## 📊 Project Overview

This repository implements a two-level feature extraction method for gravitational wave (GW) signal classification, combining classical convolutional autoencoders with Projected Quantum Kernel (PQK) techniques. The primary focus is to evaluate the applicability of quantum computing methods for binary black hole (BBH) merger detection.

This project was developed during an internship at the [Astronomical Observatory of the University of Warsaw](https://www.astrouw.edu.pl/en/) in collaboration with [AstroCeNT – Particle Astrophysics Science and Technology Centre](https://astrocent.camk.edu.pl/).

### Why This Matters

Gravitational waves (GW) are one of the most exciting discoveries of
modern astrophysics. Significant amount of information on the source of
GW signals can be extracted in order to describe astrophysical objects.
For example, the analysis and classification of these signals can offer
a powerful detection tool for binary black hole coalescences. GW signals
are noise-dominated times series, making their detection a difficult
task. In this work we present a method of a two-level feature extraction
from GW signals that uses classical convolutional auto-encoders followed
by Projected Quantum Kernel-based feature extractor. The goal of this
study is to assess if there is hope for application of these particular
methods for BBH mergers detection. We use the dataset, recently
published on Kaggle and produced by the G2-NET collaboration.
We follow the approach published in Huang et al. Nat. Comm. 12:2631 (2021).
